# Lisa's Arcade Game

To run and play this game, install all of the files in the archive to your directory. It is self-contained. Once your have done so, double click the index.html file to open it in a browser to begin.

Use the arrow keys to navigate the player throughout the canvas. If you reach the water without colliding with a bug, you will be awarded one point. If you collect a gem, you will be awarded 10 points. Once you have collected all of the gems, you win. If you collide with a bug, you'll be sent back to the bottom of the canvas to start over without losing points.
